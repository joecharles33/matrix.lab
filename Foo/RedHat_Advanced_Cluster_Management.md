# Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management

There are 2 (or more?) methods to deploy Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management - CLI and webUI.  For now, I am going to use the webUI and the Operator Hub.

Browse to your OpenShift Cluster Console | Operators | OperatorHub
Click on Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes | Install 
I accept the defaults and click Install

You'll need to retrieve your "pull secret" from cloud.redhat.com
Create a new secret "acm-pull-secret"
Click on Installed Operators | Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes 
Click on MultiClusterHubs | Create MultiClusterHubs
Click on YAML View 
change
spec: {} 
to...
spec:
  imagePullSecret: acm-pull-secret
